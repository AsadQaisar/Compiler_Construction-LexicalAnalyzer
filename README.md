# Lexical Analyzer for Compiler Construction

This repository contains the project developed as part of the **Compiler Construction** course, focusing on the **Lexical Analysis** phase. The Lexical Analyzer is implemented in both **Python** and **C#**, providing a comprehensive understanding of how input source code is tokenized.

---

## Features

- **Tokenization**: Breaks input source code into tokens such as:
  - Identifiers
  - Keywords
  - Operators
  - Literals
  - Special symbols
- **Multi-Language Implementation**:
  - Python
  - C#
- **Educational Focus**: Simplifies understanding of the lexical analysis process.

---

## Purpose

The project demonstrates the first stage of a compiler — **Lexical Analysis** — by processing source code into a stream of tokens for subsequent stages like parsing and semantic analysis. 

---

## Files

- **Python Implementation**: `lexical_analyzer.py`
- **C# Implementation**: `LexicalAnalyzer.cs`
